#NHS Hospital Stay Prediction with Alteryx
Comprehensive Framework for Forecasting Hospital Stay Durations in NHS Back Surgery Cases
This project applies Alteryx to build a predictive model aimed at optimizing hospital stay durations for back surgery patients in the NHS. By analyzing patient, surgery, and hospital data, the framework helps streamline resource allocation, improve patient care management, and support operational decision-making for healthcare providers.

#Project Title:
Optimizing Hospital Stay Predictions for Back Surgery Patients in NHS using Alteryx

#Description:
The project focuses on leveraging Alteryx’s powerful data analytics and workflow automation to predict hospital stay durations for back surgery patients within the NHS system. Through data preparation, model development, and statistical analysis, the project delivers a predictive solution to improve the NHS's planning, resource management, and operational efficiency. Using patient demographics, surgery details, and hospital resource usage, the project builds predictive models to help forecast length of hospital stays, which aids in scheduling and operational planning.

The interactive workflow in Alteryx allows healthcare providers to visualize patient data and forecast outcomes, thus enhancing patient care and resource allocation. The outcome supports better planning of bed usage, medical staff allocation, and hospital costs.

#Key Tools Used:
Alteryx: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and predictive modeling. Alteryx’s intuitive workflow designer allows automation of data preparation and modeling tasks, streamlining the process of forecasting hospital stays.
Alteryx Predictive Tools: Utilized built-in machine learning models, such as Linear Regression and Boosted Model, to predict hospital stay durations.
Dashboards & Reporting: The Alteryx workflow generates reports and data visualizations that can be easily interpreted by healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

#How to Use:
Download the Alteryx Workflow (.yxmd file) from the repository.
Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that the patient, surgery, and hospital data are correctly formatted.
Run the Alteryx Workflow:
Open the workflow in Alteryx Designer.
Connect your dataset (or use the sample provided).
Click the Run button to execute the workflow and generate predictions.

#View Results:
The workflow outputs predicted hospital stay durations in a tabular format.
Reports and visualizations are generated, showing the impact of patient demographics, surgery type, and resource use on predicted stay durations.

#Key Features:
Data Preparation: Cleaned, filtered, and standardized patient and hospital data using Alteryx’s data preparation tools to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Applied machine learning models (Linear Regression, Boosted Models) to predict hospital stay durations based on patient and surgery data.
Operational Efficiency: Predicting hospital stay durations enables NHS administrators to optimize bed occupancy, staffing, and resource allocation for better operational planning.
Visual Reporting: Alteryx’s reporting tools were used to create dashboards for visualizing trends in hospital stay durations, helping healthcare providers make data-driven decisions.

#Project Outcomes:
Improved Resource Allocation: Predictive models helped optimize the allocation of hospital beds and medical staff by accurately forecasting patient stay durations.
Enhanced Operational Planning: With better forecasts, NHS could plan better for bed occupancy, reducing overcrowding and improving patient care.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Alteryx's visual tools allowed healthcare administrators to use data insights for informed decisions regarding resource planning and patient management.

#How to Run:
Install Alteryx Designer: Ensure that Alteryx is installed on your machine.
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
Open the Workflow in Alteryx: Use Alteryx Designer to open the .yxmd file.
Connect Data: Ensure that your dataset (or the provided example data) is connected to the workflow.
Run the Workflow: Click on the Run button to execute the model and generate predictions for hospital stay durations.
View the Results: Access the output reports, visualizations, and predictions directly within Alteryx.

#Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Prediction Accuracy: The model aims for an accuracy of 85-90% in predicting hospital stay durations based on patient demographics and surgery details.
Improved Bed Occupancy: The NHS can achieve an estimated 20% improvement in bed occupancy planning by utilizing the model's predictions.
Operational Efficiency: A 15% reduction in hospital resource misallocation through more accurate forecasts of patient stays.
Cost Reduction: By optimizing resource use, the project targets a 10% reduction in hospital operational costs.
Patient Care Optimization: Predictive insights help improve patient outcomes by enabling better planning of resources and minimizing delays in patient care.

#Conclusion:
This project, using Alteryx, delivers a robust solution for predicting hospital stay durations within the NHS. By improving forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency, healthcare providers can better manage hospital resources and enhance patient care outcomes. This data-driven approach paves the way for future advancements in healthcare operations and management.
